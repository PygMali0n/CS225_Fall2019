 * the operation was added.  This is done by:
 * 1. Visiting pixels within the image based on the order provided by the ImageTraversal iterator and
 * 2. Updating each pixel to a new color based on the ColorPicker
 *
 * While applying the FloodFill to the image, an Animation is created by saving the image
 * after every `frameInterval` pixels are filled.  To ensure a smooth Animation, the first
 * frame is always the starting image and the final frame is always the finished image.
 *
 * (For example, if `frameInterval` is `4` the frames are:
 *   - The initial frame
 *   - Then after the 4th pixel has been filled
 *   - Then after the 8th pixel has been filled
 *   - ...
 *   - The final frame, after all pixels have been filed)
